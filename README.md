**DEPRECATED:** The `SnocVect` datatype can be found in the [containers](https://github.com/idris-community/idris2-containers) package going forward. This package will no longer be maintained aside from potentially making changes to keep it compiling against the latest Idris2 builds. Even that is not a guarantee.
